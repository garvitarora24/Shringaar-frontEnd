                    HOW TO APPLY MASKARA
                </h1>
                <p>When it comes to eye makeup, mascara is nothing less than a magic wand that can completely transform
                    your look, helping you flaunt voluminously thicker eyelashes without using fake lashes. But if
                    you‚Äôve been avoiding mascara frequently to avoid smudging your eyeshadow or a perfectly drawn winged
                    eyeliner, this one is you. Though applying mascara seems easy, most people still end up with clumpy,
                    spidery lashes. So, if the question ‚Äòhow to use mascara properly?‚Äô still haunts you, read on and
                    learn the right way to get fluttery and bold lashes in no time</p>

                <p>Foundation makeup helps create a flawless makeup base for the rest of your makeup. But not all
                    foundations are the same. They vary in formula, coverage, finish, etc. You also have different
                    foundations for oily skin, foundations for dry skin, foundations for combination skin, etc. Here are
                    some of the most common types of foundation makeup based on their formula.</p>
